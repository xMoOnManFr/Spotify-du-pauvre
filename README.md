# Spotify-du-pauvre
I'm trying to make a recreation of spotify in python to have it run locally to have better audio quality

All the code in this repo is mine but can be edited in the way everyone wants i don't have a problem with it don't worry, anyways i'm a beginner in python so it's not the best possible.
I am open to critics
